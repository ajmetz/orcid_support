# ORCID Support Plugin

The ORCID Support Plugin provides basic ORCID functionality for an EPrints repository
including the addition of a new ORCID metafield, ORCID rendering, validation, and basic reporting.

The documentation is hosted in the EPrints Wiki: https://wiki.eprints.org/w/ORCID_Support#ORCID_Support

The ORCID Support Plugin is also available on the [EPrints Bazaar](http://bazaar.eprints.org/).
